PHP 5.4 Short Array Syntax Converter
================================

Command-line script to convert and revert PHP's `array()` syntax to PHP 5.4's short array syntax`[]` using PHP's built-in tokenizer.

By relying on the PHP tokenizer, nothing but the array syntax itself will be altered. The script was successfully tested against code bases with more than 5.000 PHP files.


Usage
================================

    Usage: php convert.php [-w] <file>

    
Run the script with the path of the PHP file you wish to convert as argument. This will print the converted source code to STDOUT. 
    
You can add the `-w` switch if you want to overwrite the original file with the converted code.

If you want the script to process PHP files with short open tags (`<?`) as well, you need to make sure that the [`short_open_tag`](http://php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.short-open-tag) setting is enabled in your `php.ini` file.
    
In case of any error, an error message is written to STDERR and the script exits with a return code of 1.

Use `find` to convert a whole directory recursively (on Linux/Mac):

    find <directory> -name "*.php" -exec php "convert.php" -w "{}" \;

Or on Windows (thanks to John Jablonski for suggesting):

    FOR /f "tokens=*" %a in ('dir *.php /S/B') DO php convert.php %a -w
    
In case you don't trust the script yet, you can even perform a syntax check after conversion:

    find <directory> -name "*.php" -exec php -l "{}" \; | grep "error:"


Revert
================================

    Usage: php revert.php [-w] <file>

**Reverting has not yet been thoroughly tested, so use with extreme precaution!**

Since there is no specific token for the short array syntax, it assumes every "[" is an aray and relies on checking the previous token for a variable, object property, function return ")", nested array "]" and variable reference "}".
